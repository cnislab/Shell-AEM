Sustainion - Anion Exchange Membrane
The chain.pdb file contains a single polymer chain with 50 residues.The aminoacids.rtp file contains information of the atomic charges in each residue. The Sustainion polymer is described by the residues [STH], [STM], [STT], [MST], [MS1] and [MS2]. The ffnonbonded(1).itp file contains information on the nonbonded parameters for each atom type in aminoacids.rtp. The ffbonded.itp file contains information on the bonded parameters.
